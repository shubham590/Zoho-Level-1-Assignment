Comment App

So, this web dev app has Signup,Signin, Forgot Password and a Homepage.
In Homepage user is allowed to write comments which he/she wants to share only after he/she is a registered user and is logged in.



To run this app please follow these steps :

1. First open a text file named database query and copy the query present inside it and run it on phpmyadmin.
2. The file named config.php is used to make connection to database.
3. Upload php files on server to run the app.



I would also like to address a problem that whenever a user closes his/her browser without signing out from homepage,his/her logged in status does'nt gets updated in th edatbase hence on clicking filter button, comments from logged out user will still be visible. So in order to avoid this problem he/she has to sign off before exiting the browser.
